# FoodBERT

This part of the programm is forked from https://github.com/chambliss/foodbert.
It's used for data preparation and cleaning so the dataset can be used.

FoodBERT is based on DistilBert (can be seen here https://huggingface.co/chambliss/distilbert-for-food-extraction?text=1+large+whole+chicken)

Calculation are be done on the machine so no hugging-face API needed.
